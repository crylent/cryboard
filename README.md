# Android MIDI Keyboard

## About

My largest project, MIDI Keyboard application for Android. 
Many features that I have already implemented and even more are planned. 
This application is based on my own [library](https://github.com/crylent/midilib) responsible for producing sound.

## Features

- 36 built-in instruments
- Creation of new instruments by stacking sine, triangle, sawtooth and square oscillators
- ADSR envelope adjustment
- 8 tracks
- Recording and playback
- Metronome
- Octave switch
- Projects can be saved and reopened
- Projects can be exported as .prj (cryboard project), .mid (MIDI file) or .wav (audio file)
- Can open and import external .prj and .mid files
